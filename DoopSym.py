# This is a fork of Doopy, https://github.com/philipforget/Doop
# Doop detects duplicate images, and I want to extend it to let
# the user delete duplicate images while replacing the deleted
# files with symbolic links to the other and still-existing 
# detected file. 
# 
# The purpose I have in mind is for a very image-heavy
# website with tens of thousands of images, to be able to free 
# up duplicates without resulting in many of your pages
# having broken images due to the symbolic linking.
# 
# Guess I'll call it DoopSym.
# 
# Hmm..
